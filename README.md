### A Single Page App. written in React, Redux and styled Components.

=> 3 Themes available ( terminal, tamata, skypea )
*Themes are hard coded, change the active theme property*

*example*
```javascript
// @src/index.js
<ThemeProvider theme={ theme.skypea }>
```

**tip** :eight_pointed_black_star: *Your IDE most probably won't recognize **.styled** file format -> Just set syntax highlighting to regular **Javascript***

First time using styled components -> **THAT WAS AWESOME** :sparkling_heart:
